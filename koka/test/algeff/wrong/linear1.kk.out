test/algeff/wrong/linear1@kk(12, 9): type error: operation put needs to be linear but is handled in a non-linear way (as 'ctl')
 context: handle(action)
 fun get() { s }
 ctl put(t) { s := t; val x : int = resume(()); s := t; x + resume(()) }
 term : put(t)
 hint : use a 'val' or 'fun' operation clause instead
test/algeff/wrong/linear1@kk(10, 3): type warning: operation put is declared as 'fun' but handled here using 'ctl'
