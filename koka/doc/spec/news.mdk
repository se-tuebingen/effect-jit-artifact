News:

* 2024-03-14: Xavier Leroy is teaching a fantastic
  [lecture series](https://www.college-de-france.fr/fr/agenda/cours/structures-de-controle-de-goto-aux-effets-algebriques) on
  control structures and algebraic effects at the Coll&egrave;ge de France with many invited talks available online.
  March 14 will be a talk on the design and compilation of efficient effect handlers in Koka.

* 2024-03-04: Koka v3.1.1 released with a language server crash fix.

* 2024-02-14: Koka v3.1.0 released with a concurrent build system
  and improved language service over the stdio protocol. Redesign of named effect
  typing to match the formal system more closely. See `samples/handlers/named` for examples.

* 2024-01-25: Koka v3.0.4 released with improved VS Code hover and inlay information.
  Splits `std/core` in multiple modules, fixes bug in infinite expansion for implicits
  and various other small improvements.

* 2024-01-13: Koka v3.0.1 released with improved VS Code integration and inlay hints. Initial support for
  locally qualified names and implicit parameters (see the `samples/syntax`). Various small bug fixes.

* 2023-12-30: Koka v2.6.0 released with VS Code language integration with type information, jump to definition,
  run test functions directly from the editor, automatic Koka installation, and many more things.
  Special thanks to [Tim Whiting](https://github.com/TimWhiting) and [Fredrik Wieczerkowski](https://github.com/fwcd) for all their work on making this possible!

* 2023-12-27: Update of the technical report on "[The functional essence of binary trees][fiptree-tr]" where we use fully-in-place programming and
  the new hole contexts to create fully verified functional implementations of binary search tree
  algorithms with performance on par with imperative C implementations.

* 2023-07-03: Koka v2.4.2 released: add support for `fip` and `fbip` keywords described
  in &ldquo;FP<sup>2</sup>: Fully in-Place Functional Programming&rdquo;
  (ICFP'23) [[pdf](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2023/05/fbip.pdf)].
  Various fixes and performance improvements.

* 2021-02-04 (pinned) The [Context Free](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS4FAVeYW_IaZqAbqhlvxlA)
  youtube channel posted a short and fun [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olISecOUX1g&t=959s)
  about effects in Koka (and 12 (!) other languages).

* 2021-09-01 (pinned) The ICFP'21 tutorial
  "_Programming with Effect Handlers and FBIP in Koka_" is now available on
  [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OFhD_mHtKA).

* 2022-02-07: Koka v2.4.0 released: improved specialization and `int` operations, add `rbtree-fbip` sample,
  improve grammar (`pub` (instead of ``public``, remove private (as everything is private by default now)),
  `final ctl` (instead of `brk`), underscores in number literals, etc), rename `double` to `float64`, various bug fixes.

* 2021-12-27: Koka v2.3.8 released: improved `int` performance, various bug fixes, update wasm backend,
  initial conan support, fix js backend.

* 2021-11-26: Koka v2.3.6 released:
  `maybe`-like types are already value types, but now also no longer need heap allocation
  if not nested (and `[Just(1)]` uses the same heap space as `[1]`),
  improved atomic refcounting (by Anton Lorenzen), improved specialization (by Steven Fontanella),
  various small fixes, add `std/os/readline`, fix build on freeBSD

* 2021-10-15: Koka v2.3.2 released, with initial wasm support
  (use `--target=wasm`, and install [emscripten] and [wasmtime]),
  improved reuse specialization (by Anton Lorenzen), and various bug fixes.

* 2021-09-29: Koka v2.3.1 released, with improved TRMC optimizations, and improved reuse
  (the rbtree benchmark is as fast as C++ now), and
  faster effect operations. Experimental: allow elision of `->` in anonymous
  function expressions (e.g. `xs.map( fn(x) x + 1 )`) and operation clauses.
  Command line options changed a bit with ``.koka`` as the standard output directory.

* 2021-09-20: Koka v2.3.0 released, with new
  [brace elision](https://koka-lang.github.io/koka/doc/book.html#sec-layout) and if/match
  conditions without parenthesis. Updated the javascript backend
  using ES6 modules and BigInt. new `module std/num/int64`, improved effect operation performance.

* 2021-09-05: Koka v2.2.1 released, with initial parallel tasks, the binary-trees benchmark, and
  [brace elision](https://koka-lang.github.io/koka/doc/book.html#sec-layout).

* 2021-08-26: Koka v2.2.0 released, improved simplification (by Rashika B), cross-module specialization (Steven Fontanella),
  and borrowing annotations with improved reuse analysis (Anton Lorenzen).

* 2021-08-26: At 12:30 EST was the live Koka tutorial at
